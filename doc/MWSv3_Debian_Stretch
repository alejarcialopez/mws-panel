Debian Stretch was released on 17 June 2017, and the end of full support for Jessie has been announced for ~6 June 2018: https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases#Current_Releases.2FRepositories.

https://wiki.debian.org/NewInStretch

and
https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/amd64/release-notes/ch-whats-new.en.html

The linux kernel goes from 3.16 series to 4.9 series.

== PHP ==

Stretch has PHP 7.0 (as opposed to 5.6 in Jessie).

There is documentation on the changes that may be needed for PHP 7.0 in

http://php.net/manual/en/migration70.php

and

https://wiki.php.net/rfc/remove_deprecated_functionality_in_php7

Known sites likely to be affected:

noggin.pdn.cam.ac.uk: unless they have updated pmwiki, they'll be
affected by changes to preg_replace (the /e modifer has been deprecated since 5.5, and
support for it has been removed in 7.0). Advice is to use preg_replace_callback instead:

http://php.net/manual/en/function.preg-replace.php

== MySQL/MariaDB ==

Jessie has MySQL 5.5. In Stretch
all MySQL packages have been superseded by equivalent MariaDB packages (MariaDB 10.1)


From https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/amd64/release-notes/ch-whats-new.en.html#mariadb-replaces-mysql

"MariaDB is now the default MySQL variant in Debian, at version 10.1. The stretch release introduces a new mechanism for switching the default variant, using metapackages created from the mysql-defaults source package. For example, installing the metapackage default-mysql-server will install mariadb-server-10.1. Users who had mysql-server-5.5 or mysql-server-5.6 will have it removed and replaced by the MariaDB equivalent. Similarly, installing default-mysql-client will install mariadb-client-10.1.

Note that the database binary data file formats are not backwards compatible, so once you have upgraded to MariaDB 10.1 you will not be able to switch back to any previous version of MariaDB or MySQL unless you have a proper database dump. Therefore, before upgrading, please make backups of all important databases with an appropriate tool such as mysqldump.

The virtual-mysql-* and default-mysql-* packages will continue to exist. 
MySQL continues to be maintained in Debian, in the unstable release. See 
https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/MySQL for current information about the mysql-related software available in Debian."

MariaDB have a page on transitioning in Debian at
https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/moving-from-mysql-to-mariadb-in-debian-9/

They strongly recommend doing a full database backup before doing the upgrade.

Notes on the upgrade from MySQL to MariaDB from https://wiki.debian.org/NewInStretch :

"The upgrade from MySQL to MariaDB may require you to run the mysql_upgrade command. If you see errors like Incorrect definition of table mysql.event: expected column 'sql_mode' at position 14 to have type set... in /var/log/mysql/error.log, this is probably your first step.

The upgrade from MySQL to MariaDB may also require you to change user passwords from the "old" format to the "new" format. If you get errors like Server is running in --secure-auth mode, but 'wikiuser'@'localhost' has a password in the old format; please change the password to the new format upon connection, try resetting the user's password https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/set-password/ " 




We could in theory get MySQL packages from repo.mysql.com
(http://repo.mysql.com/apt/debian/dists/stretch/ has mysql-5.6, mysql-5.7 and mysql-8.0).

The virtual-mysql-* packages are listed in https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/MySQL/virtual-mysql-server,
and the schema changes to use default-mysql-* at https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/MySQL/default-mysql-server

== Python ==

Continues to provide two versions of Python: 2.7 and 3.5 (instead of 3.4). We're currently using 2.7.
The versions in stretch are 
2.7.13 and 3.5.3. 

We hope to be able to support both versions of Python in Stretch (we only have support for 2.7 in Jessie).

== Perl ==

goes from 5.20 to 5.24.
