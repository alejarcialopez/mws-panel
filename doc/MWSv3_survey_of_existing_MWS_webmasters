Subject: Planning the future of the Managed Web Service

You are receiving this as an administrator of a web site hosted by the
Managed Web Service.

The design of the current MWS, and the hardware that supports it, is
approaching end of life. We are taking this opportunity to review the
service that we provide and would welcome your input. We'd be interested to
know what you like about the current service, what you don't like, and what
new features you'd like to see (though we obviously can't promise to provide
everything that everyone would like). If you'd like to contribute to this
process then please could you add comments under the following headings and
send the results to me (Jon Warbrick, jw35@cam.ac.uk) in the next couple of
weeks:

1) What you like about the current service (and so wouldn't want to
   lose)?

2) What you don't like about the current service that you would like to
   see changed?

3) What new features would you like to see?

4) Which MWS web sites do you administer?

In addition, would you be willing to participate more closely as a member of
a user group who will be involved in reviewing proposals for a new MWS and
in evaluating eventual implementations?  Participation will require some
time commitment - perhaps an hour or so a week spread over several months -
and will involve reviewing proposals, contributing to discussions, testing
implementations, and probably a small number of face-to-face meetings.
Please contact me directly if you'd be interested in participating.
