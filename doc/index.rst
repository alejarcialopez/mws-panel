=================================

The Managed Web Service panel is a Django web application which provides the

    vmlifecycle
    sitesmanagement

The documentation for the panel is broken into a number of sections:

:any:`gettingstarted`
    Information for new developers on how to clone and run a local development
    version of the panel application.
:any:`vmlifecycle`
    A description of the "lifecycle" of the VMs we manage from preallocation
    through assignment to a user. The lifecycle of the VMs is entirely managed
    by the panel application
