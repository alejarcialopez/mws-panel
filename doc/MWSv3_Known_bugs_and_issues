List of reported bugs/issues


i) Error message when uploading PO pdf

From Juha Jäykkä <jj411@cam.ac.uk>   2016-10-20


"There is a bug in your upload page, which prevents it from accepting PO 
obtained from CUFS. They either have too long file names or the web
interface 
expects a lower case "pdf" extension. CUFS supplies upper case "PDF"
extension 
and about 20 characters long file names. Renaming the file to lower case and
7 
characters (the PO number, as you saw) allowed me to upload it.

Please note that the file I managed to upload is bit-by-bit identical to the
one I did not manage to upload, so the check "is this a PDF file" on your 
website is broken."


ii) Default website not always "default"

iii) mod_authnz_ldap needed for LDAP

We have mod_ldap, but not mod_authnz_ldap, loaded. 
AuthLDAPUrl is provided by mod_authnz_ldap.

FIXED: mod_authnz_ldap has been added.

iv) Reduce frequency of "only one administrator" messages?
Mat Ridley (mjr66) asked about this.

v) exim4 log permissions

/var/log/README.MWS3 implies the exim logs are readable. The mainlog, etc. files in
/var/log/exim4 are world-readable, but the directory permissions are

       drwxr-s-- 2 Debian-exim adm

so users can't read the logs.

FIXED: permissions are now -rw-r--r-- 1 Debian-exim adm 10420 Jun  5 10:03 /var/log/exim4/mainlog
