The 'new' (Spring 2016) [http://www.ucs.cam.ac.uk/managed-web-service/ Managed Web Service] attracts a annual charge which depends on the size of server being used. To help keep MWS's finances straight this charge also applies to use inside the UIS (which we'd still like to encourage, where appropriate).

External users are expected to upload a purchase order as part of the payment process. To reduce the administrative load, our Finance Team have agreed that this isn't necessary for internal UIS use. Internal users should upload a copy of an approved requisition form and the Finance office will arrange the necessary internal transfers. The form should show clearly the account from which the money should be transferred, and should obviously be approved by an appropriate budget holder.
